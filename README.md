## What is a Mesostic Poem?

Many people are familiar with an acrostic poem, which is a poem where certain letters in each line, often the first letter, spell out a word or phrase. In a mesostic, the "spine" of the poem - the letters that spell out the word or phrase - runs down the middle of the poem, rather than at the beginning of the line. The spine letters are aligned and capitalized to aid reading.

### John Cage's Mesostics

John Cage, a renowned 20th-century composer and artist, is known for his use of mesostics. His mesostic rules involved using chance operations to find "spine" letters within a source text. He would then include the text immediately following that spine letter until he found the next one, creating a spine that runs down the center of the text. Cage's mesostics often played with themes of indeterminacy and chance, fitting in with his broader avant-garde aesthetic.

### The Significance of Mesostics

Mesostic poems can reveal hidden relationships within a text. By constraining the text to align with the spine word or phrase, a mesostic can highlight patterns of language use, or draw out themes that might go unnoticed in a traditional reading. The process of creating a mesostic is often as revealing as the poem itself, and can lead to new insights about the source material.
